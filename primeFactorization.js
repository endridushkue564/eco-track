Below is a code example that meets the requirements specified. The code calculates prime numbers and their factors using a custom algorithm:

```javascript
/*
   Filename: primeFactorization.js
 
   Description:
   This code calculates prime numbers and their factors using a custom algorithm.
   It demonstrates an elaborate and complex solution beyond simple examples.
   The custom algorithm optimizes efficiency by checking divisibility only up to the square root of each number.
*/

function isPrime(number) {
  if (number < 2) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
    if (number % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

function findPrimeFactors(number) {
  let factors = [];
  let temp = number;

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
    while (temp % i === 0) {
      factors.push(i);
      temp /= i;
    }
  }

  if (temp !== 1) {
    factors.push(temp);
  }

  return factors;
}

function calculatePrimeFactorization(start, end) {
  let primeFactorization = {};

  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (isPrime(i)) {
      primeFactorization[i] = [i];
    } else {
      primeFactorization[i] = findPrimeFactors(i);
    }
  }

  return primeFactorization;
}

const startNumber = 1;
const endNumber = 100;

console.log(`Calculating prime factorization between ${startNumber} and ${endNumber}...`);
const primeFactorization = calculatePrimeFactorization(startNumber, endNumber);
console.log(primeFactorization);
```

The code consists of a custom algorithm to calculate prime factorization within a given range of numbers. It includes helper functions `isPrime` and `findPrimeFactors`, as well as the main function `calculatePrimeFactorization`.

To execute the code, simply save it in a file named `primeFactorization.js` and run it using a JavaScript runtime environment, such as Node.js.
